The idea of this assignment was to recreate a Dublin bikes geolocation app, I found it a very difficult task but did what I could
to the best of my knowledge. What I found most difficult was trying to get my application consistently as I developed my app
stage by stage and I would test it and make sure it worked the further I got into it. I had my biggest problem trying to use
the JSON to extract the bikes information from the web to a structured format within my app, I constantly kept getting errors
within my list activity throughout the development of the app. I know my json link was correct as when entered into chrome
immediately all the information needed appears. All the bike stations with the relevant latitude and longitude and available
bikes at the station.I feel myself that my laptop and android phone werenâ€™t as up to date as was needed to complete this task.
I felt I had the majority of the code correct but was unable to build and run my app through the computer or through a physical
device such as my phone.
